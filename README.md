    --secondary-color: #2563EB;
    --accent-color: #1E40AF;
    --background-color: #F3F4F6;
    --text-color: #111827;
}
```

### Adding Features

The Flask application is modular and easy to extend:

- Add new routes in `app.py`
- Create new templates in the `templates/` directory
- Extend the database schema as needed
- Add new export formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py`:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
   ```

2. **Database permissions**: Ensure the application has write permissions in the project directory

3. **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

### Development Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default, which provides:
- Automatic reloading when files change
- Detailed error messages
- Debug console

## Security Notes

This is a simulation application for learning purposes. For production use, consider:
