Summary computer is slow
Description
Hi, my computer has been running really slow lately. It takes a long time to boot up, and even after logging in, apps like Outlook and Chrome take forever to open.

Sometimes the system freezes for a few seconds when switching between programs. I've noticed this happening more over the past week, especially in the mornings. | haven't installed anything new recently, and I've already tried restarting a few times. Can someone please check what's going on?
